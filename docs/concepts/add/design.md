The goal of the design process is to create all artifacts (models) that are required to instantiate and manage resources, services, and products on the ECOMP platform. The design process requires input from users with multiple roles.

Design progresses logically through a series of phases. Each phase:
* is organized into steps that are completed in sequence
* is accessed using a different role with specific responsibilities
* generates artifacts that are used in other phases of design or when instantiating or monitoring VFs

The Design section describes:
* Pre-Onboarding
* Resource Onboarding
* Service Design
* VF Creation and Testing
* Governance Approval and Service Distribution
* Control Loop Design
* Policy Design
* SDC Artifacts List
